PureOSeq_c_t_s.coc are files containing the list of ALL pure O-sequences of length s+1 of the form: [ 1 , c , …. , t ].

They are generated by t monomials of degree s in c variables (all c variables actually appear).

The list is called PureOSeq_c_t_s, and is written in CoCoA syntax:

PureOSeq_c_t_s:=[…];
